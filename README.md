## Step 1: Coming up with MVP

Upon starting, I brainstormed all relevant features and picked 3 _key_ features for my MVP.

Features: 
* **Initial assessment** ("How difficult do you want your workouts to be? How many days per week?")
* **Manual workout planner & tracker**: Client 
* **Pre-curated workouts**: The ap curates a set of workouts based on what the client wants today (Do they want an arm-abs workout, leg day, or full body? How much time do they have?)
* Authentication
* Stats
* Connect & chat with "workout buddies" 

The three features in bold are what I chose to focus on first. Once my MVP is in place, I will implement those in order.

## Step 2: Building API Endpoints

Based on my MVP, I began to create API endpoints before working on front-end features.
